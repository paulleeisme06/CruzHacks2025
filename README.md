# Spritz – Affordable Alternatives to Luxury Fragrances

**Spritz** is a web application built to help users find affordable alternatives—or "dupes"—for high-end perfumes and colognes. Aimed at students, budget-conscious shoppers, and everyday consumers who love great scents without the luxury markup, the app uses AI and web scraping to deliver personalized recommendations. Users simply paste the URL of a luxury fragrance product into the app, and it returns similar-smelling, budget-friendly options along with images, detailed information, and database-generated comparisons.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters a URL of a high-end fragrance product.
2. **Web Scraping**: The backend uses **Puppeteer** to scrape the product page's HTML.
3. **Fragrance Analysis**: The HTML is sent to the **Gemini API**, which identifies the product name and classifies it into a predefined scent category (e.g., floral, woody, citrus).
4. **Database Lookup**: The backend queries a **PostgreSQL** database (running in a Docker container) to find exact or category-based dupes.
5. **AI-Powered Results**: If matches are found, they’re returned to the user along with product images, purchase links, and LLM-generated descriptions and comparisons.
